This project explores using JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) dynamically. By completing these tasks, you will practice selecting HTML elements, responding to user events, dynamically modifying attributes, and interacting with APIs. Each task builds on core JavaScript skills used in front-end development.

## Learning Objectives

- Use JavaScript to select, modify, and manipulate HTML elements.
- Respond to user actions using event listeners.
- Dynamically add, remove, and toggle classes or elements.
- Fetch and display data from external APIs using Fetch API.
- Understand asynchronous JavaScript and Promises.
